This project includes a completely revamped version of the code for
FIRST team 399's 2012 season robot, X-1. The revamping of code was prompted by a review of old code.
This review facilitated a reimplementation of the elements that worked well and a removal of
unnecessary elements. 
Much motivation for this project was through the Japanese philosophy of
Kaizen, or improvement for the better, with an emphasis on cutting out waste and overly hard work.


Rather than listing what is new in this brand new version, it is much easier to list what has stayed the same:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  -Image processing algorithms

  -Shooter velocity control algorithms

  -Initial Configuration of robot components



Other files included in this project:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  -A sample autonomous - Sample autonomous program written using the new system of text file reading

  -A writeup - Writeup created to help explain the robot code's creation, operation, algorithms, and thought processes in one concise document

  -A series of test plans - A series of plans for testing the robot in various situations
